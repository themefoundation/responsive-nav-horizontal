Mobile First Horizontal Navigation
=========================

An honest attempt to make a beautiful, accessible, cleanly coded, mobile first, responsive navigation system with drop down submenu support. Ideally, it would work like this:

* By default, display menu items centered with spacing for small screen sizes.
* Progressively enhance to support toggled visibility of a vertical mobile menu.
* If menu fits on a single row, show horizontal menu instead.
* At media query breakpoint, display horizontal menu.
* At each point, submenus should be accessible via drop downs. 

I'm not really sure how this will work out. Input is welcome.

HTML structure will follow the default WordPress menu output. CSS/Javascript will take inspiration from sources such as the Superfish menu and responsive-nav.com.
